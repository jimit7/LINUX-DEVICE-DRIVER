Buildroot philosophy-:
You may be wondering if it matters whether or not you get the exact configuration
right at the time you generate the toolchain if you can change it later on, and the
answer depends on the way you anticipate using it. If you plan to create a new
toolchain for each target, then it makes sense to set everything up at the beginning
because it will reduce the risks of getting it wrong later on

Yocto philosophy:-
If, on the other hand, you want to build a toolchain that is generic and you are prepared to provide
the correct settings when you build for a particular target, then you should make
the base toolchain generic, which is the way the Yocto Project handles things.
